🐍 Tkinter Python Snake Game

An implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and the standard Tkinter GUI library. This project is a great way to learn about game loop mechanics, basic graphics, and event handling in Python.

🌟 Features

Classic Gameplay: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer.

Collision Detection: Game ends upon collision with the walls or the snake's own body.

Difficulty Scaling: The snake's speed increases slightly after every food item is consumed (to a minimum speed of 50ms).

Dual Controls: Supports both Arrow Keys and WASD for movement.

Modern Aesthetics: Dark theme with vibrant color contrasts for a clean look.
