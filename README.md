## 🎮 Features
- Smooth gameplay with arrow keys or **WASD** controls.
- Dynamic snake growth when eating food.
- Increasing difficulty: game speed accelerates as the snake grows.
- Score tracking with live updates.
- Restart option via **button** or pressing **R** after game over.
- Clean and modern UI with customizable colors.
